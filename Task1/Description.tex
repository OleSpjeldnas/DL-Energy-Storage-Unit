\textbf{Objective:}\\
To describe the temperature of the solid and the fluid respectively, as a function of time, given a training set containing measurements.\\
\textbf{My Approach:}\\
The training set was noisy, so I denoised it using rolling window. I built one MLP for the fluid, and one for the solid.
